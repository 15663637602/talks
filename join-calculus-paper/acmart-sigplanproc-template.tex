\begin{abstract}
Join calculus (JC) is a declarative message-passing concurrency formalism
that has been ignored by the software engineering community, despite
its significant promise as a means of solving the problems of concurrent
programming. I introduce \texttt{Chymyst}, a new open-source framework
that aims to bring industry-strength JC programming to Scala practitioners.
Taking advantage of its embedding into the Scala language, \texttt{Chymyst}
enhances JC with features such as arbitrary non-linear join patterns
with guard conditions, synchronous rendezvous, time-outs, and incremental
construction of join definitions. The current implementation also
performs static analysis of user code, early error detection, and
automatic performance optimizations. To ease the learning curve for
engineers unfamiliar with the concepts of JC, I develop a pedagogical
presentation of JC as an evolution of the well-known Actor model whereby
actors are made type-safe, immutable, and are automatically managed.
By comparison with the popular Akka library, I identify a comprehensive
set of additional features necessary to make JC an industry-ready
concurrency paradigm. These features include ordered channels, APIs
for unit testing, thread pool control, and fault tolerance. I present
ways of embedding such features in JC without sacrificing its ease
of use and elegance.

\section{Introduction and summary}

Advanced programming models developed by the theoretical computer
science community are often ignored by software practitioners. One
such case is join calculus (JC)~\citep{FouGon1996}, which can be
seen as a DSL (domain-specific language) for declarative, functional
concurrent programming. Given the high importance of concurrent programming
and a growing adoption of functional languages, one would expect that
software practitioners would take advantage of this high-level and
type-safe concurrency paradigm. The message-passing idiom is particularly
suitable for implementing distributed algorithms (see, e.g.,~\citep{BarEA2007}).
Nevertheless, there appears to be no practical adoption of JC by the
software industry.\footnote{ A Google search yields a number of academic projects but no mentions
of industrial JC use.} Perhaps not coincidentally, there are very few open-source implementations
of JC available for download and use. To date, the only fully maintained
implementation of JC is the JoCaml language~\citep{FouEA2003}.

Another significant barrier for software practitioners is the lack
of suitable documentation and example code. The existing documentation
and tutorials for JC, such as the JoCaml user's manual\footnote{ See \href{http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html}{jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html}.},
the original authors' introduction to JC~\citep{FouGon2000}, and
the lecture notes~\citep{FouEA2003} were intended for CS graduate students
and are largely incomprehensible to software engineers.
Effective JC programming requires a certain paradigm shift and facility
with JC-specific design patterns, which is not readily achieved without
working through numerous examples.

Industry-strength frameworks must provide a number of important facilities
such as fault tolerance
and process supervision, performance tuning and metrics,
or unit testing and debugging, to name just a few. Existing
presentations of JC do not consider these features and do not describe
how they are to be integrated into the JC paradigm. Neither do any
of the existing JC implementations provide such features. This may
be the biggest obstacle for industrial use of JC.

In this paper, I present a new open-source implementation of JC as
a library called \texttt{Chymyst},\footnote{ The name is borrowed from the early treatise~\citep{Boy1661} by
Robert Boyle, who was one of the founders of the science of chemistry.} consisting of an embedded Scala DSL and a light-weight runtime engine.
The main design focus of \texttt{Chymyst} is to enable high-level,
declarative concurrency in idiomatic Scala, using the JC paradigm.
An equally important goal is to provide industry-strength features
such as performance tuning, fault tolerance, and unit testing APIs.
Finally, the \texttt{Chymyst} project offers tutorial documentation
adapted to the software developer audience, presenting numerous examples
that illustrate the patterns of programming in join calculus. In these
ways, I hope to enable industry adoption of this powerful concurrency
paradigm.

\subsection{Contributions of this paper}

I describe the main design decisions made in the \texttt{Chymyst}
project while implementing join calculus as an embedded DSL in Scala. 
\texttt{Chymyst} lifts several restrictions that are present in other
JC projects, and offers some additional features:
\begin{itemize}
\item separate definition of channel names and processes
\item arbitrary non-linear patterns and guards in process definitions
\item syntax that supports synchronous rendezvous
\item incremental construction of join definitions from first-class process
definitions
\item static code analysis and early error detection
\end{itemize}
I argue that certain facilities need to be added to a JC implementation
in order to make it viable for industry adoption, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item thread pool management for performance tuning
\item time-outs for synchronous channels
\item interoperability with \texttt{Future}'s and other async APIs
\item APIs for unit testing and debugging
\item per-process fault tolerance options
\item ordered channels, message pipelining
\end{itemize}
I show how these facilities can be embedded in the JC paradigm
and describe their current implementation in \texttt{Chymyst}.

I point out specific deficiencies of the academic terminology of JC
(message / channel / process / join definition) that make it unhelpful
for explaining the concepts of JC to software developers. Instead,
I show how to describe JC as an evolution of the Actor model, which
is ideal for developers already familiar with the Akka library. When
introducing JC from scratch, I rely on the ``chemical machine''
metaphor and use the corresponding terminology (molecule / emitter
/ reaction / reaction site), which is more visual and intuitive. Synchronous
channels are presented as a shorthand for carrying out a continuation-passing
code transformation from blocking code to code that uses only asynchronous,
non-blocking channels. The continuation-passing syntax used by \texttt{Chymyst}
for synchronous channels (instead of the traditional ``\texttt{reply
to}'' syntax) makes this code transformation more transparent.

\subsection{Previous work}

Since its invention more than 20 years ago, join calculus has been
implemented by a number of researchers, typically by creating an entirely
new JC-based programming language or by modifying an existing language
compiler. It is hard to assess the practical use of these
implementations, since most of them appear to be unmaintained proof-of-concept
projects. 

Here I will not attempt to survey the theoretical advances made by
those researchers. Since the main goal of the \texttt{Chymyst} project
is to enable industry acceptance of JC, I will focus on the practical
availability and usability of the existing JC implementations.

JoCaml was one of the first implementations of JC~\citep{FouEA2003},
and remains today the best-supported one. This implementation is a
patch for the OCaml compiler, which is, however, fully compatible
with the OCaml library ecosystem. 

M.~Odersky created a new language called ``Funnel'', based on the
JC paradigm~\citep{Ode2000}. The Funnel project appears to be abandoned,
since M.~Odersky went on to develop Scala, which does not include
any concepts or features of JC \textemdash{} either in the language
itself or in its standard libraries.

G.~S.~von Itzstein implemented JC as a patch for the Java compiler~\citep{Von2004}.
The project is abandoned.

The first appearance of JC in Scala was a \textquotedblleft Join in
Scala\textquotedblright{} compiler patch by V.~Cremet (2003).\footnote{ See \href{http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~cremet/misc/join_in_scala/index.html}{lampwww.epfl.ch/$\sim$cremet/misc/join\_{}in\_{}scala/}.}
The project is unmaintained, and the Scala language has changed radically
since 2003, rendering the project unusable.

T.~Rompf implemented an experimental (unnamed) language based on
JC and illustrated its use for important application design patterns,
such as ``fork/join'' synchronization and asynchronous continuations~\citep{Rom2007}.
The project appears to be abandoned, as T.~Rompf moved on to research
on multi-stage compilation~\citep{Rom2012}.

``Joinads'' is a set of compiler patches for F\# and Haskell, developed
by T.~Petricek~\citep{PetSym2011}. The project is unmaintained.

Creating a \emph{new} programming language, either from scratch or
via compiler patches, has been a common pattern in JC implementations.
The reason seems to be the difficulty of accommodating join definitions
within the syntax of existing languages. Short-lived projects such
as Polyphonic C\#~\citep{BenFou2002}, C$\omega$~\citep{Rus2007},
Join Diesel~\citep{Ose2005}, JErlang~\citep{PloEis2009}, and Hume~\citep{HamEA2006}
also follow that pattern. All these new languages have since been
abandoned by their creators. It appears that maintaining and supporting
a completely new research language is hardly possible, even for a
corporation such as Microsoft. Therefore, we turn our attention to
implementations of JC as an embedded DSL in a well-established programming
language. 

C.~Russo created the ``Scalable Joins'' library for the .NET platform~\citep{Rus2007}.
The library is unsupported.\footnote{ See \href{https://github.com/JoinPatterns/ScalableJoins}{github.com/JoinPatterns/ScalableJoins}.}

\begin{comment}
(This is not actually JC but CSP!) In 2009, F.~Peschanski published
a JC library for the Lua language, called ``LuaPi''. The library
appears to be unsupported.\footnote{ See \href{https://github.com/fredokun/LuaPi}{github.com/fredokun/LuaPi}.}
\end{comment}

Y.~Liu implemented the basic JC primitives in 2007-2009 as part of
the C++ \texttt{Boost} library.\footnote{ See \href{http://channel.sourceforge.net/}{channel.sourceforge.net}.} 

S.~Winitzki implemented JC for
Objective-C on iOS and for Java on Android\footnote{ See \href{https://github.com/winitzki}{github.com/winitzki}.};
these projects are unmaintained. \texttt{Chymyst}
reuses some design decisions made in these earlier works.

In 2014, S.~Yallop implemented ``Join Language'' as a DSL embedded
in Haskell.\footnote{ See \href{https://github.com/syallop/Join-Language}{github.com/syallop/Join-Language}.}
The implementation uses advanced features of Haskell's type system
to provide a concise syntax for join definitions.

The first embedding of JC as a Scala DSL was P.~Haller's ``Scala
Joins'' library~\citep{HalCut2008}. Thereafter, J.~He improved
upon ``Scala Joins'' by streamlining the syntax, removing restrictions
on pattern matching, and implementing remote processes~\citep{He2014}.
\texttt{Chymyst} is a further development of P.~Haller and J.~He's
syntax for embedding JC into Scala.

C.~Russo's library~\citep{Rus2007} allowed synchronous rendezvous
in join patterns as well as incremental construction of processes
and join definitions, while T.~Rompf's language~\citep{Rom2007}
used a continuation-passing syntax for synchronous channels, instead
of the traditional ``\texttt{reply to}'' syntax. \texttt{Chymyst}
also adopts these design choices.

\section{Programming in \texttt{Chymyst}}

Neither of the words ``join'' and ``calculus'' are particularly
explanatory or visually suggestive. In my experience, the absolute
majority of software developers are unfamiliar with join calculus
or its terminology (channel / message / process), but most
Scala concurrency practitioners know about the Actor model through
the Akka library. Accordingly, I would argue that introducing JC concepts
to the Scala developer audience should build upon the existing Actor
model knowledge. However, reasoning about JC programs is most direct
and convenient when using the visual metaphors and the terminology
of the ``chemical machine'' (molecule / reaction). The next subsection
is a brief overview of JC as seen through the chemical machine metaphor,
in order to establish terminology. This introduction is suitable also
for readers not already familiar with either JC or the Actor model.

\subsection{The chemical metaphor for concurrency}

To begin, one imagines a \textbf{reaction site}, i.e.~a virtual place
where many molecules are floating around and possibly reacting with
each other. Each molecule has a chemical designation (such as \texttt{a},
\texttt{b}, \texttt{c}) and also \emph{carries a value} of a fixed
ground type (such as \texttt{Unit} or \texttt{List{[}Int{]}}). Since
the ``chemistry'' here is completely imaginary, the programmer is
free to declare any number of chemical designations and to choose
the corresponding value types. In \texttt{Chymyst}, these declarations
have the form
\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{val c }} & \text{\texttt{= m[List[Int]]}}\\
\text{\texttt{val t }} & \text{\texttt{= m[Unit]}}
\end{align*}
which creates new \textbf{molecule emitters} as local values
\texttt{c} and \texttt{t}. Emitters can be seen as functions that
are called in order to emit the corresponding molecules into the reaction
site:
\begin{align*}
 & \text{\texttt{c(List(1,2,3))}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{t() }//unit value implicit}
\end{align*}
The newly emitted molecules will carry the specified values of the
correct types since the emitters are statically typed.

Further, the programmer defines the ``chemical laws'' describing
the permitted reactions between molecules. For reactions, \texttt{Chymyst}
uses the syntax of Scala partial functions with a single \texttt{case}
clause, wrapped into an auxiliary method called \texttt{go()}, for
example:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case t(\_) + c(x ::~xs) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} c(xs) \}}}
\]
This reaction consumes two input molecules, \texttt{t()} and \texttt{c()},
and evaluates the reaction body (the Scala code in the body of the
\texttt{case} clause). In this example, the reaction body simply emits
one molecule, \texttt{c()}, carrying a computed new value \texttt{xs}.
In effect, this reaction computes the tail part of a list.
Due to the pattern-matching condition, this reaction will start only
when the molecule \texttt{c()} carries a non-empty list value.

In \texttt{Chymyst}, reaction definitions may use all features of
Scala partial functions, including arbitrary guard conditions and
pattern matching constructs.

Reactions are first-class values:
\[
\text{\texttt{val r1 = go \{ case t(\_) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} println("done") \}}}
\]
Creating the reaction value \texttt{r1} does not actually run a computation;
it merely defines the available computation declaratively. In order
to make the chemical machine run reactions, the programmer needs to
create a reaction site using the \texttt{site()} call, such as \texttt{site(r1,
r2)}, which activates the reactions listed as the arguments. A reaction
site typically includes several reactions declared inline for brevity:
\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{site(}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{go \{ case t(\_) + c(x ::~xs) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} c(xs) \},}}\\
 & \text{\text{\texttt{go \{ case c(Nil) }}\texttt{\ensuremath{\Rightarrow} done() \}}}\\
\text{\texttt{)}}
\end{align*}
Once a reaction site with these reactions is created, the molecules
\texttt{t()} and \texttt{c()} can be emitted into it. The chemical
machine will interpret the declared ``chemical laws'' and start
reactions whenever appropriate input molecules are available. Typically,
reactions will emit new molecules, and the chemical machine will continue
monitoring all declared reaction sites, looking for further reactions
to run. Any number of
different reactions may start concurrently if their input molecules
are available.

Thus, JC application code defines a number of molecule emitters and
reaction sites with reactions, and then emits a number of initial
molecules. Emitting a molecule is a non-blocking operation: reactions
will start concurrently with the emitting process. In this way, JC
models arbitrary asynchronous and concurrent computations.

The \texttt{Chymyst} project embraces the chemical metaphor and its
visually suggestive terminology. In the academic literature on JC,
molecule emitters are called ``channels'', emitting a molecule with
a value is called ``sending a message on a channel'', blocking molecules
are ``synchronous messages'', reactions are ``processes'', and
reaction sites are ``join definitions.'' To make the reading of
the present paper easier for academic researchers, I use the academic
terminology in what follows, except when describing pedagogical approaches
to JC. 

\subsubsection{Synchronous channels as shorthand for continuations}

In a completely asynchronous, non-blocking programming style, a continuation
can be used in order to simulate waiting until some concurrent computations
are finished. However, using asynchronous channels with continuations
is a bit cumbersome: The continuation function must be explicitly
created as a closure and passed as a message value. Manually creating
a continuation results in ``stack ripping''~\citep{Ady2002}, which
disrupts the normal code flow. 

The JoCaml implementation of JC uses synchronous channels to mitigate
this problem. For example, a JoCaml process 
\[
\text{\texttt{def a(x) \& f(y) = reply x+y to f}}
\]
defines \texttt{f()} as a synchronous channel. \texttt{Chymyst} also
implements synchronous channels as a first-class language feature.
\texttt{Chymyst's} chosen syntax for synchronous channels resembles
continuation-passing style and looks like this:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case a(x) + f(y, reply) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} reply(x+y) \}}}
\]
The ``reply'' expression can be seen to resume the continuation
in the process that sent the \texttt{f()} message. The syntax of \texttt{Chymyst}
makes this semantics more explicit.

Synchronous channels are defined using the syntax \texttt{val f =
b{[}T, R{]}}, where \texttt{T} is the type of the message value and
\texttt{R} is the type of the reply value. Here is a more detailed
example of a \texttt{Chymyst} process with a synchronous channel:
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \text{\texttt{val f = b[Int, Int]}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{site( go \{ case f(x, reply) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow}}}\\
 & \text{\text{\texttt{  val y = ...} //compute some value}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{  reply(y) }//resume continuation}\\
 & \text{\texttt{\} )}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{val z = f(123) }//wait for reply}
\end{align*}
Note that the message \texttt{f(123)} is sent without specifying the
continuation argument \texttt{reply}, which is nevertheless available
in the reaction body. The semantics of the blocking call \texttt{f(123)}
is equivalent to capturing the current continuation as \texttt{reply}
and sending the tuple \texttt{(123, reply)} as a message on the channel
\texttt{f}.

As I will show below in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Non-linear-join-patterns},
this syntax yields additional flexibility in defining
synchronous processes.

\subsection{The \texttt{Chymyst} flavor of JC}

In this section, I compare the implementation of JC in \texttt{Chymyst}
to that of JoCaml and motivate the relevant design choices and enhancements.

\subsubsection{``Chemical'' syntax}

The syntax ``\texttt{a(x) + b(y)} $\Rightarrow$ ...'' is reminiscent
of the notation for chemical reactions. It is somewhat easier to read
than the traditional JC syntax ``\texttt{a(x) \& b(y)}''.

Sending a message in \texttt{Chymyst} is implemented as a function
call such as ``\texttt{a(1)}'' and does not require a special keyword
such as JoCaml's ``\texttt{spawn}''.

\subsubsection{Explicit channel definitions}

JoCaml defines new channels implicitly, as soon as a new join definition
is written. However, implicit declaration of new channels is not possible
in \texttt{Chymyst} because Scala macros cannot insert a new top-level
symbol declaration into the code. So, channel declarations and their
types need to be explicit (``\texttt{val a = m{[}Unit{]}}'') and
written separately from process definitions. This is a common design
in embedded DSL implementations of JC.

The separation of channel definitions from process definitions brings
several advantages. One is the ability to create a number of new channels
at run time and to define processes for them incrementally (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:First-class-process-definitions}
below), which removes the requirement to specify all processes in
a join definition at compile time. Another is an increased code clarity
due to the explicit labeling of blocking vs.~non-blocking channel
types, which remains implicit in JoCaml.

A drawback of this separation is that programmers might define a new
channel but forget to define any processes waiting on that channel.
Sending messages to such ``unbound'' channels is an error that can
only be detected at run time because channels are first-class values
and, for instance, can be passed as parameters to functions that send
messages on those channels. 

\texttt{Chymyst} throws an exception if the application code attempts
to send a message to an unbound channel. An exception is also thrown
when a new process is being defined that uses a channel already bound
to another join definition. (In that case, JoCaml silently redefines
the channel name, creating a potential for bugs.) These exceptions
are generated at ``early'' run time, immediately after creating
the join definition and before running any processes.

\subsubsection{Non-linear join patterns\label{subsec:Non-linear-join-patterns}}

Another enhancement is the lifting of the linearity restriction for
join patterns. In \texttt{Chymyst}, a process may wait on any number
of repeated channels:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case a(x) + a(y) + a(z) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} a(x+y+z) \}}}
\]
Some computations are most directly
expressed in this form. A strictly linear-pattern JC implementation,
such as JoCaml, would require cumbersome auxiliary definitions to
implement equivalent behavior.

Processes may also wait on repeated \emph{synchronous} channels. This
last feature, together with the continuation-passing syntax for those
channels, enables a declarative implementation of synchronous rendezvous~\citep{Mil1999}
where two distinct users of the same channel can exchange values:
\begin{align*}
 & \text{\texttt{go \{ case f(p1, reply1) + f(p2, reply2) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{ ~ ~ ~ reply2(p1); reply1(p2)}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{\}}}
\end{align*}
The traditional JC reply syntax (\texttt{reply x to f}) does not allow
the code to select the specific copy of \texttt{f()} to which a reply
is sent. JoCaml can express equivalent behavior only at the cost of
using two additional channels and an additional process that also
performs a synchronous reply. 

\subsubsection{First-class process definitions\label{subsec:First-class-process-definitions}}

Since process definitions in \texttt{Chymyst} are first-class values,
join definitions can be constructed incrementally at run time by aggregating
a dynamically defined number of process definitions. For example,
the well-known ``dining philosophers'' problem has a simple declarative
solution in join calculus (see e.g.~\citep{VarAgh2013}, Sec.~5.4.3)
where, however, the number of philosophers needs to be defined statically.
In \texttt{Chymyst}, this solution can be easily extended to $n$
philosophers by creating $n$ philosopher channels at run time, defining
an array of $n$ processes for these channels, and aggregating the
$n$ processes into a join definition. 

A run-time dependent number of channels and processes can be defined
like this,
\begin{align*}
 & \text{\texttt{val cs = (1 to n).map(\_ \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} m[Int])}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{val rs = (1 to n).map(i \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} go \{ ... \})}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{site(rs: \_*) \textnormal{//join definition}}}
\end{align*}

Despite this, processes and channels remain immutable. Once a join
definition has been created, is impossible to modify its constituent
processes or to add more processes waiting on the same channels.

\subsubsection{Static code analysis}

Scala's macros are used extensively in \texttt{Chymyst} for user code
analysis. The \texttt{go()} method is a macro that gathers detailed
compile-time information about input and output channels of each defined
process. For example, the process definition
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case t(\_) + c(x ::~xs) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} c(xs) \}}}
\]
internally produces a rich information structure indicating that the
process waits on the channels \texttt{t} and \texttt{c}, that the
channel \texttt{t} may have arbitrary message values while \texttt{c}
requires a nontrivial pattern match with two pattern variables, and
that the process will finally send a message on channel \texttt{c}
(but not on \texttt{t}).

Using this information, \texttt{Chymyst} detects certain errors in
user code, such as unavoidable livelock and non-determinism. An example
of unavoidable livelock is the process
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case c(x) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} c(x+1) \}}}
\]
Since the process accepts messages \texttt{c(x)} with any value \texttt{x},
the programmer has no means of stopping the infinite loop that follows
once a message is sent on channel \texttt{c}. This \texttt{Chymyst}
code generates a \emph{compile-time} error, with a message indicating
unavoidable livelock.

\begin{comment}
Deadlocks can only happen when using synchronous channels and are
harder to detect reliably. A deadlock warning is given when the process
sends a synchronous message followed by another message that is consumed
together with the synchronous one:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case a(\_) + c(x) + f(\_, r) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} c(f() + 1); r(x) \}}}
\]
This code is suspicious because the process waits for a reply to \texttt{f()}
and \emph{then} sends \texttt{c()}, while a reply to \texttt{f()}
happens only \emph{after} both \texttt{f()} and \texttt{c()} are sent.
\end{comment}

Unavoidable nondeterminism occurs when one process waits on a subset
of messages that another process is also waiting on, for instance
\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{site( }} & \text{\texttt{go \{ case c(x) + i(\_) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} c(x+1) \},}}\\
 & \text{\text{\texttt{go \{ case c(x) }}\texttt{\ensuremath{\Rightarrow} done() \} )}}
\end{align*}
If both \texttt{c()} and \texttt{i()} messages are present, the runtime
engine has a choice of whether to run the first or the second process.
The programmer has no control over this choice, since there are no
conditions on the value \texttt{x} of the \texttt{c(x)} message. It
is unlikely that the resulting non-determinism would be useful in
any practical application. \texttt{Chymyst} assumes that this is a
programmer's error and throws an exception. The exception is thrown
at ``early'' run time.

An additional benefit of static analysis is a performance optimization
for processes that use pattern matching or guard conditions. For process
definitions that impose no conditions on input message values, a quicker
scheduling algorithm is used. Additionally, complicated cross-molecule
guard conditions such as
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case c(x) + d(y) if x>0 \&\& y<1 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}
\]
are converted into the conjuctive normal form and factorized if possible.
For instance, the example above is converted to (pseudo-code)
\[
\text{\texttt{c(x if x>0) + d(y if y<1) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...}}
\]
In many cases, this transformation allows the runtime engine to find
new runnable processes faster.

Static analysis is also used to enforce the linear type discipline
on synchronous channels. For instance, this \texttt{Chymyst} code
will generate a compile-time error:
\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{go \{ case f(x, reply) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow}}} & \text{\texttt{ if (x>0) reply(x)}}\\
 & \text{\text{\texttt{ else false \}}}}
\end{align*}
Correct usage of synchronous channels requires that a reply is sent
in all clauses of an \texttt{if} / \texttt{else} or \texttt{match}
/ \texttt{case} expression.

\subsection{Details of the current implementation}

\texttt{Chymyst} implements each join definition as a separate instance
of class \texttt{ReactionSite}. A reaction site is a virtual place
where messages arrive and wait to be consumed by auto-created JC processes.
A \texttt{ReactionSite} instance contains the list of available processes
and their properties, a JVM thread pool for running the processes,
a message multiset holding the message values currently present, and
a separate JVM thread dedicated to process scheduling and bookkeeping
operations. The decision to make scheduling single-threaded was motivated
by the desire to avoid thread contention and to make process scheduling
faster.

Since join definitions are local \emph{values} (although they are
not directly available to the application code), new join definitions
can be created dynamically at run time. Nevertheless, join definitions
are immutable since the user cannot access a reaction site.

Channels are local values available to the application code. Each
channel is an instance of class \texttt{M} for asynchronous channels
or \texttt{B} for blocking (synchronous) channels. A channel holds
a reference to the join definition where its messages are consumed;
according to the JC semantics, each channel must be bound to a unique
join definition.

When a message is sent on a channel, the message's value is appended
to the message multiset at the respective join definition. At the
same time, a ``process search'' job is queued to be run on the scheduler
thread of that join definition. The process search will examine the
messages currently present in the multiset and determine which processes
(if any) will be scheduled to run. These processes will then be queued
on the reaction site's thread pool, after the consumed messages are
atomically removed from the message multiset. 

Due to using separate threads, sending a message as well as running
a process are asynchronous, concurrent operations, as they should
be in JC. The number of available concurrent execution threads can
be specified per join definition (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:Thread-pools}).

Reactions that impose complicated cross-molecule conditions may take
a comparatively long time to schedule because the process search may
need to enumerate many possibilities before it finds appropriate molecule
values. Since the process search is performed asynchronously on a
dedicated scheduler thread, sending a message is always a quick operation.
The downside is a somewhat slower scheduling of all processes due
to additional thread switching.

\subsection{What it means to be industry-strength}

To determine the feature set required for ``industry strength,''
I have reviewed the widely used Akka actor framework as described
in~\citep{AIA2016} and other similar books intended for sofware
engineering audiences. These books suggest that the industry expects
a concurrency framework to implement features such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item logging facilities for execution tracing and for performance metrics 
\item unit testing with assertions about asynchronous behavior of messages 
\item fault tolerance, various scenarios of recovery from errors, per-process
supervision
\item timeouts for blocking calls
\item graceful stop and graceful restart, possibly separately for each join
definition 
\item a standard library of join definitions that establishes the relevant
design patterns
\item thread pool management, thread priority, configurable performance
tuning
\item ordered message queues for asynchronous pipelines
\item interoperability with other asynchronous APIs such as \texttt{Future's},
Actors, Tasks, or a library of adapters to other async frameworks
\item deployment-time configuration facilities for distributed and remote
execution (e.g.~cluster deployment)
\item consistent distributed data management (CRDT) support
\end{itemize}
No currently available descriptions or implementation of join calculus
include \emph{any} of these features. JoCaml provides a remote messaging
facility\footnote{ See \href{http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/distributed.html}{jocaml.inria.fr/doc/distributed.html}.},
but the burden of implementing a robust distributed application and
configuring its deployment rests fully on the JoCaml application code.
There does not appear to be any JoCaml-based industrial implementations
of distributed applications.

I will now describe the features that \texttt{Chymyst} currently supports.

\subsubsection{Thread pools\label{subsec:Thread-pools}}

To enable users to fine-tune the performance of their concurrent applications,
\texttt{Chymyst} offers control over the JVM thread pools used by
join definitions. There is a default thread pool available, but users
may create other thread pools and assign them to join definitions.
Application code can create two types of thread pools: a \texttt{FixedPool}
holds a fixed specified number of JVM threads, while a \texttt{BlockingPool}
is aware of blocking operations (such as sending synchronous messages)
and will increase and decrease the number of threads dynamically at
run time in order to maintain a given parallelism. Optionally, application
code can set a specific thread priority for the thread pool's processes.

A typical use case for separate thread pools is an application with
two join definitions, one having a large number of slow processes
and another with a small number of fast processes. For instance, the
``fast'' join definition might be reporting the progress achieved
by the ``slow'' processes. Since it is desirable to obtain timely
progress reports, the ``fast'' join definition is typically required
to have low latency as compared with the ``slow'' join definition.
The application code achieves this by using separate thread pools
for the two join definitions:
\begin{align*}
 & \text{\texttt{val tpFast = FixedPool(1)}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{val tpSlow = FixedPool(cpuCores)}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{site(tpFast)(...) \textnormal{//first join definition}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{site(tpSlow)(...) \textnormal{//second join definition}}}
\end{align*}

A thread pool can be shut down, which will cause the join definition(s)
using it to stop processing messages.

\subsubsection{Timeouts}

The call that sends a message on a synchronous channel,
e.g.~\texttt{f(x)}, will be blocked until a reply is received. In
\texttt{Chymyst}, it is possible to specify a timeout for this blocking
call: 
\[
\text{\texttt{f.timeout(2 seconds)(x)}}
\]
The replying process can also check whether the waiting
process received the reply or timed out. This is implemented
as a \texttt{Boolean} return value from a reply function \texttt{r}:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case f(\_,r) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} if (r("done")) ...~\}}}
\]
The reply-sending call \texttt{r()} returns \texttt{true} only if
the waiting process did not time out. This timeout-checking functionality
may be sometimes required to avoid race conditions when using timeouts
on synchronous channels.

\subsubsection{Ordered channels}

In JC, the message consumption order is not specified and may be chosen
arbitrarily by the implementation. However, certain applications\textemdash notably,
asynchronous streaming pipelines\textemdash require messages to be
processed in the order sent. Because of the practical importance of
asynchronous pipelines, it appears that an implementation of JC should
have direct support for ordered channels. It would be too inefficient
to implement ordered message processing on top of unordered JC by,
say, attaching an extra timestamp to each message and enforcing message
order via process guards.

Not all JC programs are compatible with ordered channel semantics.
Consider the case of several processes waiting on the same channel
with different conditions on the message value, 
\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{site( }} & \text{\texttt{go \{ case c(0) + a(x) \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\},}}\\
 & \text{\text{\texttt{go \{ case c(y) if y>0 }}\texttt{\ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\} )}}
\end{align*}
If the channel \texttt{c} is implemented as an ordered message queue,
a message \texttt{c(0)} will block the queue and prevent any processes
from running until a message \texttt{a(x)} becomes available so that
\texttt{c(0)} may be consumed. This behavior is certainly undesirable.
Programs like this one can achieve satisfactory performance only if
processes are able to consume messages out of order.

Given a JC program, \texttt{Chymyst} automatically assigns ordered
queues to \emph{all} channels that could admit ordered semantics without
adverse effects. Such channels are called ``pipelined'' in the \texttt{Chymyst}
source code.

For a channel \texttt{c} to be pipelined, the processes waiting on
\texttt{c} must be such that, at any time and for any message \texttt{c(x)}
on the channel, one of the three statements is true:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the message \texttt{c(x)} can be consumed immediately by some process
\item it can be determined that \texttt{c(x)} will never be consumed by
any process
\item at this time, no messages on channel \texttt{c} can be consumed at
all
\end{enumerate}
Equivalently, the condition for \texttt{c(x)}
to be potentially consumable should be independent of the presence of other
messages on this or other channels. If this holds for
a channel \texttt{c}, a JC implementation can achieve the correct
JC semantics by only inspecting a single message on the channel \texttt{c}
when choosing new processes to run.

To formulate this condition more rigorously, consider that each of
the defined processes $P_{1}$, ..., $P_{n}$ introduces a predicate
$p_{i}(x,a,b,...)$ that determines whether the process $P_{i}$ can
start and consume \texttt{c(x)}. These predicates depend on the presence
of input messages and on their values. Here we denoted by $x$ the
value of the message \texttt{c(x)} on channel \texttt{c}, while $a,b,...$
are some variables that describe other channels on which the $i$-th
process is waiting. The condition for \emph{some} process consuming
\texttt{c(x)} to start is
\[
\bigvee_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}(x,a,b,...).
\]
 \texttt{Chymyst} uses static analysis to try factorizing this Boolean
expression as
\[
\bigvee_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}(x,a,b,...)=p_{c}(x)\wedge q(a,b,...)
\]
for some predicates $p_{c}$ and $q$. The factorized Boolean formula
$p_{c}(x)\wedge q(...)$ indicates that the condition $p_{c}(x)$
for being able to consume \texttt{c(x)} is logically independent of
any other messages that may be currently present. If this Boolean
factorization exists, \texttt{Chymyst} marks \texttt{c} as a pipelined
channel with the predicate $p_{c}$. 

Another optimization for pipelined channels is that \texttt{Chymyst}
will discard all messages \texttt{c(x)} for which $p_{c}(x)$ does
not hold: these messages will never be consumed by any processes.

\subsubsection{Logging and unit testing}

In the author's experience, errors in JC programs are often due to
messages that should have been sent but were not, and to erroneous
process definitions that start processes where they should not have.
A straightforward approach to debugging these situations is to examine
the execution trace of a join definition. Such a trace would show
the decisions made by the a join definition's scheduler after each
new process search, detailing whether a new process was scheduled,
and what messages were present at that time on any channels.

\texttt{Chymyst} includes an event reporting facility that allows
join definitions to write an execution trace to console or to memory.
A design issue is how to indicate in the application code that a certain
join definition needs to log its trace. In \texttt{Chymyst}, as in
JoCaml, user code has no direct access either to join definitions
themselves or to the message multisets held by join definitions. This
is a useful encapsulation and safety feature. However, user code can
assign a thread pool to each join definition, and thus it is convenient
to attach an event reporting interface to thread pool objects:
\begin{align*}
 & \text{\texttt{val tp = FixedPool(2).withReporter(reporter)}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{site(tp)( ... )}}
\end{align*}
Frequently used event reporters are supplied by \texttt{Chymyst},
and application code can define custom event reporters. This facility
is suitable for reporting errors and for gathering runtime performance
metrics. 

However, logging is inadequate as a means of verifying the desired
functionality of a JC program. For this reason, \texttt{Chymyst} implements
a special \texttt{Future}-based API that can be used for unit testing. 

For any chosen channel, the unit testing API can be used to obtain
a Scala \texttt{Future} that completes when: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a message was sent on this channel
\item process search has concluded and involved a message sent on this channel
\item a message present on this channel was consumed by a new process
\end{itemize}
The process search event may have a positive outcome (a new process
was scheduled, consuming this message) or a negative outcome (no new
processes could be scheduled), in which case the \texttt{Future} will
fail.

The unit testing API can be used to verify correctness of asynchronous
process logic embodied in a JC program, without changing the program's
code. For example, one could write a test that, sends a message on
a certain channel, waits until that message is consumed, then waits
until a new message is sent on another channel, and finally asserts
a condition on the value of the new message.

The unit testing API also allows users to write tests that are robust
against varying execution speed, since there is no need to wait for
some arbitrarily chosen ``reasonable'' time before checking for
conditions to hold.

The API just described applies to asynchronous channels. Synchronous
channels block and thus generally do not require a special API for
testing. However, a useful convenience is to be able to convert a
blocking message call into a \texttt{Future}, which makes sending
the message a non-blocking call. This facility is available as the
\texttt{futureReply()} method on blocking channels.

\subsubsection{Process supervision}

Since processes run on separate JVM threads, the application will
not automatically receive a notification when a process throws an
exception and fails. \texttt{Chymyst} supervises all processes and
catches their run-time exceptions, reporting them to the user via
the logging mechanism. Additionally, \texttt{Chymyst} will warn the
user if a process fails to reply to a synchronous channel.

If it is expected that an exception will sometimes occur but the failure
is transient, the user may specify an option to retry running the
process:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case ...~\}.withRetry}}
\]
A more general supervision mechanism is to attach a second process
that could recover from expected failures:
\[
\text{\texttt{go \{ case ...~\}.onError(e \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} go \{ case ...~\}) }}
\]
The recovery process receives the same input messages as the failed
process and also may use the exception value \texttt{e}. The
recovery code will run on the same thread and can be visualized
as a direct replacement for the failed process.

\subsection{Pedagogical considerations}

The choice of terminology and notation is important if we aim to explain
an unfamiliar paradigm clearly and comprehensibly to newcomers. Here
we again encounter difficulties when it comes to learning about join
calculus. 

The Wikipedia page on JC describes it as ``\emph{an asynchronous
$\pi$-calculus with several strong restrictions: 1) Scope restriction,
reception, and replicated reception are syntactically merged into
a single construct, the }definition\emph{; 2) Communication occurs
only on defined names; 3) For every defined name there is exactly
one replicated reception.}''\footnote{ See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-calculus}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-calculus},
as of June 2017.}

Explanations using technical jargon such as ``replicated reception''
or ``communication on defined names'' are impenetrable for anyone
not already well-versed in the concurrency research literature. Since
Wikipedia is the most popular go-to resource for learning new concepts,
it is quite understandable that software practitioners today remain
unaware of join calculus.

Another obstacle for comprehending JC is that academic literature
typically uses the terms \textquotedblleft channel\textquotedblright ,
``message'', and ``process'', which are inherited from $\pi$-calculus
but are not especially helpful for understanding how JC works and
how to write concurrent programs in it.

Indeed, a channel in JC holds an \emph{unordered} collection of messages,
rather than an ordered queue or mailbox, as the word \textquotedblleft channel\textquotedblright{}
suggests. Another meaning of \textquotedblleft channel\textquotedblright{}
is a persistent path for exchanging messages between fixed locations,
but this is far from the semantics of JC channels.

The phrase \textquotedblleft sending a message\textquotedblright{}
usually implies that a well-known recipient will consume messages
one by one. But this is very different from what happens in JC, where
a process may wait for several messages at once, different processes
may contend on messages they wait for, and several copies of a process
may start concurrently, consuming their input messages in non-deterministic
order.

The word ``process'' suggests a fixed, persistent thread of computation
with which we may communicate. However, JC does not have persistent
threads; instead, processes are spawned on demand as
input messages become available.

While JoCaml is currently the sole well-maintained standard implementation
of JC, its developer documentation\footnote{ See \href{http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html}{jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html}.}
is especially confusing as regards the semantics of channels, messages,
processes, and ``spawning.'' It is ill-suited as a pedagogical introduction
either to using JoCaml or to join calculus. For example, the JoCaml
manual does not clearly distinguish the notion of ``spawning'' a
new process from the usage of the \texttt{spawn} keyword, which has
a quite different semantics in JoCaml (sending ad-hoc messages on
channels).

Instead of using academic JC terminology, I follow the chemical machine
metaphor and terminology when giving tutorial presentations about
\texttt{Chymyst} programming. %
\begin{comment}
Here is a dictionary:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\end{comment}
With this approach, I have had success in conveying effectively both
the basic concepts and the subtleties of JC semantics to developers
who were previously unfamiliar with it.

\subsection{From actors to reactions}

Many Scala developers interested in concurrent programming are already
familiar with the Actor model. In this subsection, I outline how the
JC in its ``chemical machine'' presentation can be introduced
to those developers.

In the Actor model, an actor receives messages and reacts to them
by running a computation. An actor-based program declares several
actors, defines the computations for them, stores references to the
actors, and starts sending messages to the available actors. Messages
are sent either synchronously or asynchronously, enabling communication
between actors.

The chemical machine paradigm is in certain ways similar to the Actor
model. A chemical program also consists of concurrent processes, or
``chemical actors'', that communicate by sending messages. The chemical
machine paradigm departs from the Actor model in two major ways: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chemical actors are automatically started and stopped; the user's
code only sends messages and does not manipulate actor references.
\item Chemical actors may wait for a set of different messages to be received
atomically at once.
\end{enumerate}
If we examine these requirements and determine what should logically
follow from them, we will arrive at the chemical machine paradigm.

The first requirement means that chemical actors are not created explicitly
by the user's program. Instead, the chemical machine runtime will
automatically instantiate and run a chemical actor whenever some process
sends a relevant input message. A chemical actor will be automatically
stopped and deleted when its computation is finished. Therefore, the
user's code now does not create an instance of an actor but merely
\emph{defines the computation} that an auto-created actor will perform
after consuming a message. As a consequence, chemical actors must
be \emph{stateless}, and their computations must be functions of the
input message values.

Implementing this functionality will allow us to write pseudo-code
like this,
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \texttt{val c1 }\text{\texttt{= go \{ x:~Int \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{c1 !~123 }}
\end{align*}
The computation under the \texttt{go} keyword receives a message with
an \texttt{Int} value and performs some processing on it. The computation
will be instantiated and run concurrently, whenever a message is sent.
In this way, we made the first step towards the chemical machine paradigm. 

What could happen if we quickly send many messages? 
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \texttt{val c1 }\text{\texttt{= go \{ x:~Int \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{(1 to 100).foreach(c1 !~\_) }}
\end{align*}
Since our computations are stateless, it is safe to run several instances
of the computation \texttt{\{ x: Int $\Rightarrow$ ...~\}} concurrently.
The runtime engine may automatically adjust the degree of parallelism
depending on CPU load.

Note that \texttt{c1} is not a reference to a particular \emph{instance}
of the computation. Rather, the computation \texttt{\{ x: Int $\Rightarrow$
...~\}} is merely a declarative description of what needs to be done
with any message sent via \texttt{c1}. We could say that the value
\texttt{c1} plays the role of a \emph{label} attached to the value
\texttt{123}. This label implies that the value \texttt{123} should
be used as the input parameter \texttt{x} in a particular computation. 

To express this semantics more clearly, let us change our pseudo-code
notation to 
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \text{\texttt{go \{ x:~Int \textnormal{from} c1 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{c1 !~123 }}
\end{align*}
Different chemical actors are now distinguished only by their input
message labels, for example:
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \text{\texttt{go \{ x:~Int \textnormal{from} c1 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
\text{} & \text{\texttt{go \{ x:~Int \textnormal{from} d1 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{c1 !~123 }}\\
 & \text{\texttt{d1 !~456 }}
\end{align*}
Actor references have disappeared from the code. Instead, input message
labels such as \texttt{c1}, \texttt{d1} select the computation that
will be started.

The second requirement means that a chemical actor should be able
to wait for, say, two messages at once, allowing us to write pseudo-code
like this, 
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \text{\texttt{go \{ x:~Int \textnormal{from} c1, y:~String \textnormal{from} c2 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{c1 !~123}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{c2 !~"abc"}}
\end{align*}
The two messages carry data of different types and are labeled by
\texttt{c1} and \texttt{c2} respectively. The computation starts only
after \emph{both} messages have been sent, and consumes both messages
atomically.

It follows that messages cannot be sent to a linearly ordered queue,
as they will be consumed in an unknown order.
Instead, messages must be kept in an unordered bag.

It also follows from the atomicity requirement that
several computations could \emph{jointly contend} on input messages:
\begin{align*}
\text{} & \text{\texttt{go \{ x:~Int \textnormal{from} c1, y:~String \textnormal{from} c2 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}\\
 & \text{\texttt{go \{ x:~Int \textnormal{from} c1, z:~Unit \textnormal{from} e1 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} ...~\}}}
\end{align*}
Messages that carry data are now completely decoupled from computations
that consume the data. All computations start concurrently whenever
their input messages become available. The runtime engine needs to
resolve message contention by making a non-deterministic choice of
the messages that will be actually consumed. Among the several contending
computations, only one will be actually started.

This concludes the second and final step towards the chemical machine
paradigm, where ``chemical actors'' are called reactions and ``messages'' are called molecules.

It remains to use the actual Scala syntax instead of pseudo-code.
In Scala, we need to declare message types explicitly and to register
reactions with the runtime engine as a separate step.
The syntax used by \texttt{Chymyst} looks like this:
\begin{align*}

The chemical machine paradigm is a radical departure
from the Actor model.

Whenever there are sufficiently many input messages available for
processing, the runtime engine will automatically instantiate several
concurrent copies of the same reaction that will consume the input
messages concurrently. The application code
does not need to specify how many parallel processes to run at any
given time.
This helps the programmer focus on the application logic at a higher level,
because it is easier to reason about data than about processes.

Since reactions are stateless and instantiated automatically
on demand, the application code does not manipulate explicit actor
references, which is error-prone.\footnote{ For example, books on Akka routinely warn against calling \texttt{sender()}
in a \texttt{Future}, which may yield an incorrect actor reference
when the \texttt{Future} is resolved.} The application code also does not need to implement actor lifecycle
management, actor hierarchies, backup and recovery of actors' internal
state, or deal with the special ``dead letter'' actor. This removes
a significant amount of complexity from the architecture of concurrent
applications.

\section{Status and future roadmap}

\texttt{Chymyst} is an Apache-licensed open-source project published
to the Maven repository, currently at version 0.2.1. Extensive tutorial
and developer documentation is already available and is being continually
expanded. Tutorial examples include map/reduce, merge-sort, and Conway's
``Game of Life'', as well as a number of standard concurrency problems
such as the ``dining philosophers'' and the ``readers/writers.''
The \texttt{Chymyst} development workflow follows industry-standard
practices such as test-driven development and continuous integration.
Unit tests exercise all features of the DSL (with 100\% code coverage).
Timings of the process scheduling code indicate that the overhead
for starting a new process after sending a message can be as short
as 10 $\mu$s on a 2GHz laptop. 

Features on the \texttt{Chymyst} development roadmap include:
\begin{itemize}
\item a standard library of JC definitions, to implement various concurrency
patterns
\item reporting of JVM thread performance metrics via JMX
\item bindings for GUI toolkits such as JavaFX/ScalaFX
\item possible support for Scala.js (with no multithreading)
\item compile-time code transformations for performance optimization
\item use of consensus algorithms to support distributed and remote execution
\end{itemize}
Implementing these features will create a robust, full-featured, and
well-tested Scala implementation of join calculus that is viable for
industry adoption.
